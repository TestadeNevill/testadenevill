    <p>The Head of a New Town</p>
    <h2>Smart Cities</h2>
    <p>This is where I explain my interest and ideas in the billion dollar industry of Smart City urban planning and technologies. In order to build sustainable cities of the future we must utilize renewable energies, efficent grids and the state of the art infrastructure projects.  </p>
    <h2>4D Design</h2>
    <p>I've always thought in order to make or cities greener it's starts with how we generate our energy and how well we use it. Lights are everywhere, designs get creative but the technology within them only change so much. I plan to create asthecically pleasing lights as well as lights that use less energy and generate energy.</p>
