I am creating a new website to display my interest in smart cities, decorative lights and prefabricated wall segments.

As of April 27th, 2021 this app is using HTML, CSS, React and React Bootstrap.

My next update will focus on the asthetics and language I would like to use on the front page. I will then add links to other pages that will go in further detail on both smart cities and 4D Design.
 April 29th 2021 align nav bar and remove bullitens. Then add links to second sections.
 Then push to heroku for link.
 Add database if you nice?
 Mongo? SQL both for different reasons.
